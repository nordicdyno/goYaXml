About
--------

`goYaXml` â€“ Go lib for fetch & parse Yandex XML respones

<quote>Yandex.XML is a service that lets you send queries to the Yandex search engine
and get responses in XML format.</quote>

Official Yandex.XML search (need login):
* Russian: http://xml.yandex.ru/settings.xml
* English: http://xml.yandex.com/settings.xml

Warning
--------

This lib is just my game with Go language, it's usable but not completely parser
(needs a bit more work for handling whole response)

And also it just support only `Get` requests

Installation
--------

go get github.com/nordicdyno/goYaXml


Usage
---------

    yaFetch := YaXML{"com", "your_login_here", "your_key_here"}
    yr, _ := yaFetch.Query("uri_safe_query_string_here")
